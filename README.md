The analysis in this study helps to identify room for what are the factors to prescribe fewer related to gun incidents. this situation is the main motivation for this project. What are the factors to prescribe fewer related to gun incidents?

# Follow these steps to run the Project

## 1- R Libraries

The project was created an RStudio and requires the following libraries to run:

library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(tm)
library(quanteda)
library(reshape2)
library(lda)
library(wordcloud)
library(ggthemes)
library(qcc)
library(qicharts2)
library(zoo)
library(mapdata)
library(forecast)
library(scales)
library(e1071)
library(caTools)
library(Metrics)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library("RPostgres")
library(DBI)

# Install libraries

Libraries can be installed in RStudio with the following command:

install.package("library")
ex. install.packages("DBI")

## 2- Set up Postgres Database 

Our data is stored in Postgres and can be accessed from RStudio with RPostgres and DBI libraries. 
Table incidents should be created by running the ddl script gunviolence_incidents_table_ddl.sql
Dump file of the database can be found in the repository, extract and restore in Postgres.

Connection string in R expects host, username, password and database.

## 3- Load RStudio rmd file

Load file Gun Violence Final Project.Rmd to access the Project.
